# HRnet

HRnet is an online application for team management.
For this project I'm using Typescript, Vite, React and React-router.

The purpose of this project is to refactor an deprecated [JQuery site version](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end) into a modern React HRnet application.
Independently, I published the HTML Modal as a [new NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hrnet-library2) you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/fvnny-code/HRNet-Library2)
